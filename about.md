Native English copywriter James Mathison moved from the UK to Cracow, Poland, in 2014. The city captured his heart and mind, and he quickly became a valued member of the local startup community. 

Thanks to a string of fascinating projects, James decided to invest himself full-time into helping small businesses and startups in Cracow build an international platform on a foundation of premium native-English copy.

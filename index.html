        <h2>You're thinking ahead</h2>
        <p>
            Being understood internationally is now essential. </p>
        <p>
            For local Cracow trade, tourism has picked up massive steam and isn't going anywhere. For tech companies with global aspirations, the rest of the world needs to read and resonate with your story. </p>
        <p>
            You probably know that already. </p>
        <p>
            The question is, how do write English that doesn't sound slightly…wrong? </p>
        <p>
            A non-native of any language is bound to make errors that stick out, clear as days, and mark you as not <i>that</i> serious. </p>
        <p><i>*psst*…Did you catch the error I planted in the last sentence?</i></p>
        
        <h2>What to do about it?</h2>
        <p>
            There are a few alternatives, in order from best to cheapest:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Hire a great native-English copywriter with proben ability.</b> Obviously ;)</li>
            <li><b>Hire a local writer and check the work quickly with a native proofreader.</b> You won't get the same naunces baked into the language, but it will be correct. </li>
            <li><b>Use software to write better yourself.</b> Use Hemingway App to improve and tighten up your English writing, and use Grammarly to check…you can probably guess. </li>
        </ol>
